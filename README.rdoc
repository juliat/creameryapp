This is a set of models and unit tests that can be used to build the next phase of the Creamery project in 67-272.  It will also be used for a refactoring exercise for the morning section later in the semester.

This project also contains a populate script that will create 3 stores in the Pittsburgh area, 2 administrators (Alex and Mark), 6 managers (2 for each store) and 100 employees who have one or more assignments.  This should give you enough sample data for you to see how your application performs.  To generate this data, you can run 'rake db:populate' after you have created a database by running all the migrations.

We will be adding some additional files with cucumber testing features right after spring break.
